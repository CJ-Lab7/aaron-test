      <failure message="Timed out retrying: cy.click() failed because this element is detached from the DOM.

&lt;div tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; unselectable=&quot;on&quot; role=&quot;gridcell&quot; comp-id=&quot;113&quot; col-id=&quot;name&quot; class=&quot;ag-cell ag-cell-not-inline-editing ag-cell-with-height ag-cell-value&quot; style=&quot;width: 255px; left: 0px;&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

Cypress requires elements be attached in the DOM to interact with them.

The previous command that ran was:

  &gt; cy.contains()

This DOM element likely became detached somewhere between the previous and current command.

Common situations why this happens:
  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You typically need to re-query for the element or add &apos;guards&apos; which delay Cypress from running new commands.
