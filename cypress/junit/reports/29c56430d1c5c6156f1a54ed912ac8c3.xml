Cypress requires elements be attached in the DOM to interact with them.

The previous command that ran was:

  &gt; cy.eq()

This DOM element likely became detached somewhere between the previous and current command.

Common situations why this happens:
  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You typically need to re-query for the element or add &apos;guards&apos; which delay Cypress from running new commands.

Cypress requires elements be attached in the DOM to interact with them.

The previous command that ran was:

This DOM element likely became detached somewhere between the previous and current command.

Common situations why this happens:
  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You typically need to re-query for the element or add 'guards' which delay Cypress from running new commands.
