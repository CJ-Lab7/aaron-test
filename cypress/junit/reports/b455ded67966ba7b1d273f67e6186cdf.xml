      <failure message="Timed out retrying: cy.click() failed because this element is detached from the DOM.

&lt;div role=&quot;row&quot; row-index=&quot;0&quot; aria-rowindex=&quot;2&quot; row-id=&quot;0&quot; comp-id=&quot;69&quot; class=&quot;ag-row ag-row-no-focus ag-row-even ag-row-level-0 ag-row-position-absolute ag-row-first&quot; style=&quot;height: 36px; transform: translateY(0px); border: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Cypress requires elements be attached in the DOM to interact with them.

The previous command that ran was:

  &gt; cy.contains()

This DOM element likely became detached somewhere between the previous and current command.

Common situations why this happens:
  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You typically need to re-query for the element or add &apos;guards&apos; which delay Cypress from running new commands.

You typically need to re-query for the element or add 'guards' which delay Cypress from running new commands.
