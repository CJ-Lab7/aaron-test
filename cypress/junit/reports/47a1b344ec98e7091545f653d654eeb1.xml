      <failure message="`cy.find()` failed because this element is detached from the DOM.

`&lt;div data-v-67f49d24=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;`

Cypress requires elements be attached in the DOM to interact with them.

The previous command that ran was:

  &gt; `cy.find()`

This DOM element likely became detached somewhere between the previous and current command.

Common situations why this happens:
  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You typically need to re-query for the element or add &apos;guards&apos; which delay Cypress from running new commands.
